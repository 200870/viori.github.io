      <h4 class="mt-4">Media Tactics</h4>

      <p>We will use two different social media platforms: Instagram and TikTok. </p>
      <p>These two platforms are most common to use by our target group. These two platforms clearly dominate the others, that is why we decided to put our focus on them and only them. </p>
       <p>Achieving objectives:</p> 
      <p>We will record a video campaign with young Dutch females for either Instagram and Tiktok. It will consist of one main video presenting shortcuts and several videos presenting each person separately. They will be explaining what being authentic and true to themselves means for them.</p>
      <p>Instagram</p>
      <p>We will post stories including questionnaires and polls on stories to get an interaction from the followers. 

The add on stories will contain our main video campaigns or special graphic that include our message and call to action.  

The main video will be posted on reels, as well as the videos presenting Instagram each person separately.</p>
<p>TikTok</p>
      <p>On Tik Tok we would like to create brand awareness by creating videos with our product. In the short video we would present product’s uniqueness (how they create their own scents) in order to create the viewer’s curiosity.  
We will post the main video and videos presenting people separately.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Planning</h4>
      <p>Create a planning (content calendar). In this planning, you will provide an overview when and what you will communicate on which platform.</p>

      <img alt="Image Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/2.png" width="1000">

      <img alt="Image Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/4.png" width="1000">

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>Identify and justify your learning point (based on the Communication & Media Plan). What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned. </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue.</p>
      <p>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
      <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed. (Instagram posts and videos below)</p>
